Experiment log parameters
=========================

This chapter lists the experiment log parameters most likely to be needed
in your ``.xlg`` file. These are used as inputs to the various steps. 

dest
-------
Where to save the generated output. ::

    <dc:dest xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="vibrosim_demo3_output/"/>

measident
---------
Used as a filename prefix for the various output files generated. It should be
redefined in submeasurements if they are being used.::

    <dc:measident>meas1</dc:measident> 

amplitude
---------
``amplitude`` defines the displacement amplitude of the transducer. A
calibration must be done to relate the voltage in the electronics to the
displacement of the transducer as a function of frequency. A constant 10
micron/Volt calibration file is included in VibroSim COMSOL.::

    <dc:amplitude dcv:units="Volts">3</dc:amplitude>

friction_coefficient
--------------------
Friction coefficient of the crack surface. Used to calculate the heat generated by the crack. These numbers may not match a direct friction measurement because they include non-idealized behavior, but they are interpreted as friction coefficients::

    <dc:friction_coefficient>.0661</dc:friction_coefficient>

Friction coefficient values for Ti 6-4 and Inconel 718 were evaluated empirically in late 2019/early 2020
in testing at Iowa State Unversity to be .066 and 0.146 respectively. Be warned that these values are not necessarily applicable to your material system. 

msqrtR
------
Crack heating in mode I motion can be attributed to angled friction, where
angled surfaces rub against each other while the crack as a whole opens and
closes cleanly. The ``msqrtR`` is product of the asperity density and the
typical asperity radius. ::

    <dc:msqrtR dcv:units="m^-1.5">3.14e6</dc:msqrtR>

msqrtR values for Ti 6-4 and Inconel 718 were evaluated empirically in late 2019/early 2020
in testing at Iowa State Unversity to be 3.14*10^6 m^(-3/2) and 6.77*10^6 m^(-3/2) respectively. Be warned that these values are not necessarily applicable to your material system. 

crack_model_shear_factor
------------------------
Sensitivity factor for shear vs normal heating. This was included in the model just in case empirical observation warranted it. Based on our observations, heating due to normal vibration is on the same order as heating due to the same magnitude of shear vibration, so using 1.0 here is reasonable. ::

xducerforce
-----------
Force of with which the transducer is pressed into the specimen. Used in model
creation when the couplant is attached to the model. Only used in the
``solidmech_static`` COMSOL study or by the welder model::

    <dc:xducerforce dcv:units="Newtons">0</dc:xducerforce>

tortuosity
----------
The growth mechanisms of a fatigue crack usually result in a rough crack
surface. The roughness is further exaggerated for intergranular crack growth
wherein the crack growth path can deviate from the growth plane and follow the
grain boundaries of several grains until the macroscopic applied load
(typically mode-I loading) coerces the local crack trajectory to follow the
symmetric growth plane. This process results in a fatigue crack, with planar
macroscopic trajectory, but with a very rough and tortuous local trajectory.

Crack tortuosity is quantified as the standard deviation of a distribution of
angles of node points on the crack with taken with respect to a line connecting
the end points of the crack. ::

    <dc:tortuosity dcv:units="degrees">30.5</dc:tortuosity>

draws to take at each position along the crack for calculating the crack
heating. ::
